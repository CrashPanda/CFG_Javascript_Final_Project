# Code First Girls - Intriduction to Javascript Final Major Project July 20223

The bulk of the website was created by me. I created the foundations for the rest of my team to then work on additional features such as the cart or a sub-menu. 
I have since been expanding the code to enhance the navbar and see if I can create a functional cart as my team mates struggled to do so. I may even add additional menus and pages.
Everything in the main branch was written by myself.
